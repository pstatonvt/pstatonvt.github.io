### Bio

I grew up in Bluefield, Virginia; a small town in southwestern Virginia where the population is only around 5,400. One fact many people do not know about Bluefield is that it is the tallest town in the state of Virginia, with an elevation of 2,389 feet.

After graduating Graham High School in 2010, I attended Virginia Tech, majoring in Meteorology with minors in Astrophysics/Astronomy, Geoscience, and Mathematics. During my time at Virginia Tech, I was an Astronomy Learning Assistant (LA), where I worked alongside the main Teaching Assistant (TA). My duties ranged from leading recitations to helping grade exams.

When I wasn't in class or working as an LA, I was giving tours to perspective Hokies and their families. As a Hokie Ambassador, I gave several tours each week, walking backwards and leading people through an amazing campus.

When I graduated Virginia Tech in May 2014, I set off for graduate school for a Master's in Earth Systems Science at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. For my graduate work, I focused in climate science and the education behind it. My thesis project focused on individual's views on climate change, and compared these views to the level of science education (or even more specifically, climate science education) they possessed.

In January 2017, I began working at the University of Alabama in Huntsville as a Research Associate. I am on the Data Science and Informatics Group (DSIG) as a metadata analyst and programmer. Our team works closely with NASA and its 12 Distributed Data Archive Centers (DAACS) by curating their metadata records for various satellite and aerial Earth Science missions.

In my spare time, I practice and teach yoga! I discovered yoga in January 2015 during my first year of graduate school, and have been an avid practioner ever since. I teach in both hot and non-hot studios, but I do prefer hot yoga in general; practicing in the heat forces me to focus on the here and now, and doesn't allow me to worry about things outside the yoga room.
