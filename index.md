### Bio

I grew up in Bluefield, Virginia; a small town in southwestern Virginia where the population is only around 5,400. One fact many people do not know about Bluefield is that it is the tallest town in the state of Virginia, with an elevation of 2,389 feet.

After graduating Graham High School in 2010, I attended Virginia Tech, majoring in Meteorology with minors in Astrophysics/Astronomy, Geoscience, and Mathematics. During my time at Virginia Tech, I was an Astronomy Learning Assistant (LA), where I worked alongside the main Teaching Assistant (TA). My duties ranged from leading recitations to helping grade exams.

When I wasn't in class or working as an LA, I was giving tours to perspective Hokies and their families. As a Hokie Ambassador, I gave several tours each week, walking backwards and leading people through an amazing campus.

When I graduated Virginia Tech in May 2014, I set off for graduate school for a Master's in Earth Systems Science at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. For my graduate work, I focused in climate science and the education behind it. My thesis project focused on individual's views on climate change, and compared these views to the level of science education (or even more specifically, climate science education) they possessed.

In January 2017, I began working at the University of Alabama in Huntsville as a Research Associate. An example of some of my tasks while in this position are listed below: 
 
* Manages all Python scripts being implemented in the NASA Common Metadata Repository (CMR) Analysis and Review Dashboard. These scripts serve as a major deliverable for the Analysis and Review of CMR (ARC) project.
* Includes a suite of scripts which leverage the CMR’s API, the Global Master Change Directory (GCMD) controlled value lists, and CMR’s metadata schemas to allow for automated checks of metadata records
* Writes custom script functions to perform additional automated metadata checks on an as-needed basis
* Identifies ways to enhance script performance
* Updates scripts when changes are made to metadata schemas and requirements
* Technical contact for communication regarding scripts between IMPACT and the Earth Observing Systems Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Evolution and Development (EED) team, who is responsible for maintaining the NASA CMR Analysis and Review Dashboard
* Responsible for writing script documentation on the public facing NASA Earthdata Wiki space to enhance transparency between the programming process and the users of the Dashboard tool
* Participate in the IMPACT’s effort in writing and publishing a scientific paper about the metadata curation process of the Analysis and Review of CMR (ARC) team
* Continue in the metadata curation effort which include responsibilities upon hiring

In my spare time, I practice and teach yoga! I discovered yoga in January 2015 during my first year of graduate school, and have been an avid practioner ever since. I teach in both hot and non-hot studios, but I do prefer hot yoga in general; practicing in the heat forces me to focus on the here and now, and doesn't allow me to worry about things outside the yoga room.
